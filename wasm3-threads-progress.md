# Defined shared memory and zero-timeout wait checkpoint

2026-10-12, Apple M4 Max, Darwin/arm64, Go 1.27.1. The full feature and
performance-parity objective remains open.

## Implementation

Wago `c1acd6c0` adds instance-owned shared-memory backing, separate from instance
control memory. Shared-memory exports retain the producing instance until the
last importer closes. Mapping quota checks charge both mappings; failed starts
release both. wasm-bench `c351f3d` admits the `threads-defined-v1` host profile
with threads explicitly enabled and explicit bounds checks.

Wago `05545b7d` lowers statically zero-timeout shared waits directly to native
loads and comparisons on arm64 and amd64. The lowering returns mismatch (1) or
timeout (2), preserves alignment-before-bounds trap order, and leaves parking
and notification on the existing helper path. Differential tests cover both
wait widths, shared and unshared memory, offset overflow, upper address bits,
expected-value widths, and misaligned/out-of-bounds addresses.

Wago `967218d9` admits memoryless `atomic.fence`, with original and codec-loaded
execution coverage. The [threads proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/blob/main/proposals/threads/Overview.md)
defines fences without a target memory.

The next checkpoint routes shared `memory.size` through the instance memory
directory rather than the separate control mapping. Defined and imported
memories with zero, one, and three pages execute correctly before and after
codec reload on both native architectures. The full `^TestThreads` group passes
on arm64 and amd64 after this change.

This is partial thread support. Shared-memory growth, ordinary shared-memory
access instructions, multiple memories, and broader import/segment combinations
remain restricted. JSPI and JS-string embedding profiles remain unsupported.

## Execution measurement

The wasm.fyi source-built performance contracts use 4,096 inner operations and
64 guest repetitions per invocation. Each result below is the median of three
independent launch medians, each with five oracle-verified samples, two measured
warmup batches, and adaptive batches of at least 50 ms. Units are nanoseconds
per entire guest invocation. All successful samples met the duration target.

| Contract | Defined-memory implementation | Zero-timeout lowering |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| atomic-load-store | 249,434 | not rerun |
| atomic-rmw-add | 916,967 | not rerun |
| atomic-compare-exchange | 894,102 | not rerun |
| atomic-fence | 309,458 | not rerun |
| wait-mismatch-notify | 26,154,313 | 13,418,261 |

The wait/notify contract takes 48.7% less time (1.949 times faster). Both runs
use artifact SHA-256
`a85a706319b79d0118fd21c99aa294a1f47d3cbb789a779bc4238d1f58c910f2`.
It exercises zero-timeout mismatch plus notification; it does not measure
parked waits or cross-thread wakeup latency. The five new successful contracts
bring cumulative Wago coverage in the 90-contract set from 77 to 82. They have
no successful w2c2 pair in the initial capture, so these measurements establish
Wago progress, not parity.

## Compile cost and validation

Five sequential samples per fixture compare `c1acd6c0` with `967218d9`. They
measure the zero-timeout optimization and memoryless-fence changes, not the
earlier defined-memory implementation. Timings are medians; no statistical
speedup claim is made from these sequential runs.

| Fixture | Before | After | Bytes/op before / after | Allocs/op |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Small scalar, default config | 6,300 ns | 6,079 ns | 19,202 / 19,203 | 74 unchanged |
| Small scalar, explicit Core 3 | 6,268 ns | 5,995 ns | 19,058 / 19,058 | 73 unchanged |
| Imported workers, one compiler worker | 22,104,623 ns | 22,154,409 ns | 3,420,954 / 3,420,944 | 94 unchanged |

The larger fixture's generated code remains 1,587,220 bytes. These fixtures
show no meaningful allocation increase or compile-time regression; they do
not establish peak RSS or compile cost for the entire feature corpus.

`go test -tags=wago_regalloccheck ./src/wago -run '^TestThreads' -count=1`
passes locally and on native Linux/amd64 (Ryzen 7 7800X3D, hub@hub). Defined
shared-memory tests also pass with the race detector, including concurrent
instances, producer-first close, import ownership, queued wakeup, quota
rejection, and failed-start cleanup. Backend and optimization tests pass with
the allocation checker enabled. Unsupported-proposal fail-closed tests pass.

Raw evidence remains local and ignored by Git:

- `.validation/wasm3-parity/threads-defined-arm64.json`, SHA-256 `0784a0eeab499389e8929bfe907c83c14083f5ef0d142b988cc3a61e0696eae7`.

- `threads-defined-plan.json` and `threads-zero-wait-plan.json` in the same
  directory retain commands, artifacts, oracles, and batching controls.
- `threads-compile-before.txt` and `threads-compile-after.txt` retain compile
  samples from the baseline worktree and current checkout respectively.
