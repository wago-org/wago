// This file is the WIT type vocabulary an embedder needs to declare a host
// import of any shape -- the same vocabulary wazy's own WASI 0.2
// implementation is written against. Every name here is an alias for the
// engine's internal type, not a parallel copy: there is exactly one
// representation of a WIT type in this codebase, and a descriptor an
// embedder hand-writes is indistinguishable from one the decoder produced
// from a real component binary.
//
// # Declaring a nested type
//
// A composite's children are TypeRefs. A TypeRef is either a primitive
// (inline) or a reference into a TypeTable, which is why nesting needs a
// table:
//
//	tbl := component.NewTypeTable()
//	inner := tbl.Add(component.ListDesc{Element: component.Prim("u8")})
//	outer := tbl.Add(component.ListDesc{Element: inner})
//
// The sugar constructors below (List, Result, Option, Tuple, Record,
// Variant) build the table for you, so the common case never mentions
// TypeRef:
//
//	tbl := component.NewTypeTable()
//	ty := tbl.Result(tbl.List(component.Prim("string")), component.Prim("u32"))
//
// # Values
//
// Declaring a type is half the job; a host func must also produce and
// consume values of it. See Value's doc for the Go shape of each WIT type,
// and VariantValue/ResultValue for the two that need a named struct.

// TypeDesc is one WIT type. The concrete descriptors below implement it.
// It is a sealed interface -- a type outside wazy cannot implement it,
// because the ABI dispatches on the concrete descriptors and an unknown one
// has no defined lowering.
type TypeDesc = binary.TypeDesc

// (spelled inline) or an index into the TypeTable the enclosing FuncDesc was
// built with. Prefer the TypeTable sugar constructors over building these by
// hand.
