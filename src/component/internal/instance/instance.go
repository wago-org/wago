// Package instance instantiates a decoded WebAssembly component and exposes
// its exported functions for calling. It covers the M3 "spine": a real
// component runs end to end, both the no-import export direction (M3 STEP 2)
// and the host-import direction (M3 STEP 3, this file plus host_import.go).
//
// # Scope
//
// Two component shapes are supported, and anything outside them fails loudly
// with a specific, named error rather than silently returning a zero value:
//
//   - No-import (M3 STEP 2): one embedded core module, instantiated as the
//     component's single core instance with no arguments, exporting functions
//     defined purely via "canon lift" of a core function reached through a
//     single core-export alias.
//
//   - Host-import (M3 STEP 3): the component imports one or more instances of
//     host functions (e.g. `test:pkg/host` exporting `log: func(msg: string)`)
//     that are lowered (canon lower) into core functions the guest core module
//     imports and calls. The caller supplies Go implementations via WithImport.
//     See host_import.go for the lowering/wrapper machinery.
//
// The host-import path also handles a component with zero WIT imports whose
// world *exports an interface* rather than a bare function: wit-component
// packages the lifted funcs into a nested "re-export shim" component (a
// second, fully embedded component -- binary.Component.NestedComponents)
// and an Instance that instantiates it, with the top-level export naming
// that instance. See resolveInstanceExport / bindInstanceExport in
// host_import.go for how that shim is resolved back to the outer canon
// lifts, and CallExport for how a caller reaches a function inside it. A
// canon lift's post-return option (e.g. on a function returning a string)
// is also wired here: the post-return core func is called with the lift's
// flat results immediately after lifting, per definitions.py's canon_lift.
//
// Still rejected in both: canon resource.* built-ins, non-func exports
// outside the re-export-shim shape above, multi-result functions,
// whole-parameter-list / result spilling to memory, string/list values when
// no linear memory is available, and any nested component beyond a pure
// re-export shim (e.g. the wasip2 CLI adapter shim, which embeds its own
// core module and instantiation graph -- out of scope here).
//
// # Decoder gaps worked around here
//
// The component binary decoder (internal/component/binary) does not retain the
// per-alias core:sort discriminator (func vs memory vs table vs global) on
// binary.AliasDef. Rather than require a binary change, this package
// disambiguates core-export aliases by probing the actually-instantiated
// module's exports (a name that resolves to a Function is a core-func alias; a
// memory alias does not). It also does not retain the func signatures declared
// inside an imported instance type, which is why the host-import direction
// takes the imported function's WIT type from the caller via WithImport rather
// than from the decoded component.
