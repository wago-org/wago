// This file is the engine-side surface an OUT-OF-TREE host implementation
// registers through -- the same surface wazy's own WASI 0.2 implementation
// uses. Everything here was previously unexported and reachable only from
// inside this package; a host living in another module needs all of it, so
// each is a thin exported form of the internal original rather than a
// parallel path. The component package re-exports these.

// HandleTable is one component instance's resource handle table: the thing
// that maps a guest-visible handle to the host representation behind it.
// A host func that mints an own<T>/borrow<T> nested inside a composite
// result must do so through this table (the engine translates only
// top-level handles automatically), which is what WithResourcesHook exists
// to hand over.

// its TypeRefs back to descriptors (both from a TypeTable).

// from a flat list of types, which cannot express a composite whose children
// are themselves composites; passing the FuncDesc directly can express any
// WIT type, at the cost of building the type table yourself.

// generated bindings drop handles through a canon resource.drop carrying the
