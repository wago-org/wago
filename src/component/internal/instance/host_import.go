//
// # Why this mapping has to exist
//
// A resource type has two entirely separate numberings in play at once:
//
//   - The real component binary's own type index (whatever canon.TypeIdx
//     names for a `canon resource.new/drop/rep` core func the GUEST calls
//     directly -- e.g. when its generated bindings drop an owned
//     descriptor handle). This index is specific to one particular .wasm
//     file's type section/alias layout and cannot be known in advance.
//
//   - The caller-chosen ResourceType tag an Option's own<T>/borrow<T>
//     TypeDesc uses (WithImport/withImportCustom): since this package's
//     decoder cannot retain an imported instance type's nested func
//     signatures (see wasi.go's package doc), WithImport's caller supplies
//     the FuncDesc by hand, including a self-chosen, wasm-binary-agnostic
//     resource tag (e.g. wasi.go's wasiOutputStreamResType) -- the SAME
//     tag reused across every host func that mints or resolves a handle
//     for that resource, entirely independent of any one guest binary.
//
// Both numberings key into the very same handleTable (resource.go), which
// cross-checks a handle's minting tag against every later operation's tag
// (mirroring the Canonical ABI's `trap_if(h.rt is not rt)`). Left alone,
// that check trips the moment BOTH numberings touch the same handle: a
// WithImport-registered host func mints an own<descriptor> handle tagged
// with wasi.go's constant, and the guest later drops it via a
// resource.drop canon tagged with the real (unrelated) wasm type index --
// two different numbers naming what both sides intend as the same
// resource. This was invisible until a real guest's compiled glue
// (rustc's wasi_snapshot_preview1 adapter, populating its preopens table)
// actually dropped an owned host-resource handle -- no earlier fixture's
// guest code did.
//
// withResourceTag closes that gap: resourceCanonHostFunc/
// resourceCanonHostFuncGraph, given a resource.new/drop/rep canon, try to
// trace its TypeIdx back to an (iface, name) pair the same way
// importInterfaceName resolves a lowered import's target (only possible
// when the type index names a type-sort alias exporting from an *imported*
// instance -- see effectiveResourceTypeIdx); if that succeeds and iface+
// name is registered here, the REAL wasm-level index is translated to tag
// before touching resources, so both numberings agree. A resource this
// package doesn't recognize (not registered, or genuinely guest-defined,
// e.g. real_adder's own resource type) falls back to the raw TypeIdx
// unchanged -- exactly today's existing, working behavior.
