# Public reference values

Wago's public value API represents WebAssembly 2.0 `funcref` and `externref`
with the following types:

- `ValFuncRef` and `ValExternRef` identify reference-valued signatures.
- `FuncRef` and `ExternRef` are opaque, comparable 8-byte token wrappers.
- `NullFuncRef()` and `NullExternRef()` construct null references; the zero value
  of either wrapper is also null.
- `ValueFuncRef`, `ValueExternRef`, `Value.FuncRef`, and `Value.ExternRef` move
  reference tokens through the typed `Value` API.

The underlying `uint64` slot is an opaque token. It is not a Go pointer, a JIT
code address, an instance-descriptor address, or an embedder object address.
Callers must not interpret reference bits or construct them from pointers.
`Value.Bits` and `ValueOf` remain available for the low-level slot API, but a
reference token is meaningful only under the runtime/store ownership policy that
issued it.

Token zero is reserved for null. Nullable `funcref` values execute through
function parameters/results, declared locals, direct calls, block results,
`ref.null`, and `ref.is_null` as one 64-bit slot. Non-null local `ref.func`
results now cross `Invoke`, typed `Call`, and the internal `invokeLocal` path as
stable random 64-bit tokens issued by a reference store. The token is mapped
back to the immutable internal descriptor only after an exact store lookup;
unknown, forged, cross-runtime, and cross-private-store tokens fail before native
entry. Descriptor, code, basedata, and linear-memory addresses never become the
public token.

Instances created by one `Runtime` share its reference store. Package-level
`Instantiate` creates a private store lazily on the first non-null funcref result,
so scalar-only standalone instances do not allocate a store and tokens from two
standalone instances are incompatible. Issuing a token retains the producer's
arena, code mapping, and home instance context. `Instance.Close` becomes a
logical close for such a producer and physical release is deferred until the
store releases its tokens: for a runtime store, after `Runtime.Close` and the
last attached instance closes; for a private store, when its instance closes.
Tokens are never reused within a store lifetime, so released-store tokens cannot
resolve through another store.

This first token slice deliberately issues only descriptors owned by the
returning instance. Funcrefs originating from cross-instance imports, host
imports, reference globals, and reflection-free host boundaries remain
fail-closed until their ownership paths are audited. The store-owned,
generation-checked externref handle table is also still pending.

## Typed calls and signatures

Exported signature conversion preserves `funcref` and `externref` instead of
collapsing them to `i32`. Typed `Instance.Call` checks the exact reference type
and represents a reference in one full-width ABI slot. With reference types
enabled, nullable and store-owned local non-null `funcref` function signatures
are executable; incompatible tokens fail closed as described above, and
disabling the feature rejects those signatures explicitly. `externref`
signatures remain structural metadata only until the store-owned handle
implementation lands.

## Boundary guard performance

The public guard caches two booleans with each resolved export signature, so a
cached scalar-only `Invoke` performs no per-call type walk and allocates nothing.
On July 9, 2026, the pinned single-CPU command
`taskset -c 0 go test ./src/wago -run '^$' -bench '^(BenchmarkInvokeAddOne|BenchmarkInvokeNullFuncref)$' -benchmem -count=5`
measured:

- before the guard (`aa0b6375`), scalar `BenchmarkInvokeAddOne`: 15.65–15.89
  ns/op, median 15.78 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op;
- with the guard, scalar `BenchmarkInvokeAddOne`: 16.09–16.31 ns/op, median
  16.13 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op; and
- null-funcref `BenchmarkInvokeNullFuncref`: four stable samples at 20.43–21.18
  ns/op plus one 29.80 ns/op system outlier, always 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op.

After the token store landed, the pinned single-CPU command
`taskset -c 0 go test ./src/wago -run '^$' -bench '^(BenchmarkInvokeAddOne|BenchmarkInvokeNullFuncref|BenchmarkInvokeNonNullFuncrefRoundTrip)$' -benchmem -count=5`
measured:

- scalar `BenchmarkInvokeAddOne`: 16.35–16.45 ns/op, median 16.38 ns/op,
  0 B/op, 0 allocs/op;
- null `BenchmarkInvokeNullFuncref`: four stable samples at 20.51–20.55 ns/op
  plus one 29.32 ns/op system outlier, always 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op; and
- same-runtime non-null token `id` round trip (one exact ingress lookup and one
  stable egress lookup): 35.10–37.15 ns/op, median 35.15 ns/op, 0 B/op,
  0 allocs/op.

The current scalar median is about 1.6% above the earlier post-guard 16.13 ns/op
measurement and 3.8% above the detached pre-guard 15.78 ns/op median; the samples
remain allocation-free and the scalar path still performs no type walk or store
lookup. Treat these small single-host deltas as a regression watchpoint rather
than a final performance gate.

On linux/amd64, `unsafe.Sizeof(Instance{})` is now 776 bytes versus 744 bytes at
`e54f9556`, a 32-byte per-instance increase for the store pointer and lifetime
state. `referenceStore` itself is 40 bytes and is allocated once per `Runtime`;
standalone scalar/null-only instances keep a nil store, while first non-null
egress lazily creates the private store. Each issued token adds a 24-byte entry
plus two bounded-to-store-lifetime map indexes and intentionally retains its
producer resources until store teardown.

## `.wago` compatibility

Compiled-module codec version 18 adds the WebAssembly structural type codes
`0x70` (`funcref`) and `0x6f` (`externref`) for function signature metadata.
Version 17 blobs remain rejected by a version-18 loader, and older loaders reject
version-18 blobs, so reference metadata cannot be silently reinterpreted as a
numeric type.

Reference global metadata is rejected on both marshal and load. Even a null
reference global is not admitted through `.wago` until reference-global runtime
semantics and ownership are complete. In particular, live funcref/externref
tokens and externref store identity are never serialized. Element metadata may
continue to serialize function indexes and null initializers because those are
module structure, not live host references.

## Release 2 execution harness

The official-suite harness encodes WABT's null `funcref` argument/result value as
one zero `uint64` slot and requires a zero result token. Null `externref` and
non-null reference values remain explicit reference-argument/reference-result
gaps; reference-valued globals remain reference-global gaps. This keeps gap
counts aligned with the subset the runtime actually executes.
